      "title": "Introduction",
      "duration": "5 minutes",
      "description": "Start the class by explaining what geometry is and why it's important. Use simple terms that second graders can understand. Briefly explain that geometry is the study of shapes and space.",
      "instructions": "Greet the students and introduce the topic of the day - Geometry and Basic Shapes. Engage them by asking if they have heard of the term 'geometry' before and what they know about it. Provide a simple explanation about what geometry is and its importance."

      "duration": "10 minutes",
      "description": "Introduce different shapes using flashcards. Explain the characteristics of each shape, including the number of sides and corners. Use real-world examples to illustrate each shape.",
      "instructions": "Present the flashcards one by one and ask the students to name the shapes. For each shape, discuss its attributes including number of sides and corners. Use objects in the classroom as real-world examples of each shape. For instance, use a window to illustrate a rectangle, a clock for a circle, etc."

      "duration": "10 minutes",
      "description": "Students work in pairs to explore different objects in the classroom and identify their shapes and attributes.",
      "instructions": "Pair the students and ask them to find objects in the classroom that represent the different shapes discussed. They should write down the object's shape, number of sides, and number of corners. Remind them that corners are where two sides meet."
